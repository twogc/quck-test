# 2GC CloudBridge QUICK testing

QUIC+TLS 1.3 protocol performance and reliability tester with advanced metrics, time series, ASCII graphs, network emulation, and flexible reporting.

- **Flexible metrics:** latency percentiles (p50, p95, p99), jitter, packet loss, retransmits, handshake times, TLS version, cipher suite, session resumption, 0-RTT/1-RTT, out-of-order, flow control, key updates, error types, and more.
- **Time series & ASCII graphs:** for latency, throughput, packet loss, retransmits, handshake time.
- **Network emulation:** simulate latency, packet loss, and duplication.
- **Ramp-up/ramp-down:** dynamic load scenarios.
- **Markdown, JSON, CSV reports** with tables and graphs.
- **Live TUI:** stable terminal UI with real-time metrics.
- **Prometheus metrics** endpoint.
